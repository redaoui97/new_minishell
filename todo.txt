+free leaked data
{
	ft_split_adjusted leaks data when called by ft_split_adjusted
	ft_split_adjusted leaks 100%
	make_envp leaks when changing directory (could not be something else because when I only run ls I get the same leaks)
	leaks when I change oldpwd
	leaks on cd
	++when I kill a process (ping google.com) there is a leak on path/get_path/execution
	+leaks on cd

++error expanding env vars in single quotes : first character removed
++unexpcted syntaxe error single/double quote near pipe
