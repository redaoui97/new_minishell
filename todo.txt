i-following cmd automatically kills the precedent process

+free leaked data
{
	ft_split_adjusted leaks data when called by ft_split_adjusted
	ft_split_adjusted leaks 100%
	make_envp leaks when changing directory (could not be something else because when I only run ls I get the same leaks)
	leaks when I change oldpwd
}
+still leaks even after freeing with exec_exit functions
+go through builtin commands and save the return value
+fix the wait child process (e.g : ping google.com |Â ls : should abort first command once the second is executed)
+program closes infile; outfile on each iteration meaning it even closes pipes if redirections don't exist; before another functions comes in later trying to close all pipes
+if there is a function that closes the infile/outfile; we could close the pipe fds whenver we process them in set_pipes
++heap buffer overflow issue on double quote queries
++heap buffer overflow issue on quote queries
+++cmd args on quotes/double quotes aren't stored and mistaken for redirections
++segv when given empty line 
++too many arguments on builtin functions
++if pwd env doesn't exist at the start of the program, set it to / 
++exported envs should be marked for both adding and sorting
++if var exported already exists, replace it (if the new var doesn't have a value, keep old var)
++cd home if home env doesn't exist
++error expanding env vars in single quotes : first character removed
++unexpcted syntaxe error single/double quote near pipe
+++sometimes when I make a file with redirections, I can't access the file because a random char is added at the end
